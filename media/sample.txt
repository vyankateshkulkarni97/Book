Q1. What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python
	Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Being a general-purpose language, 
	it can be used to build almost any type of application with the right tools/libraries. Additionally, python supports objects,
 	modules, threads, exception-handling, and automatic memory management which help in modelling real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems.

Benefits of using Python:

	1. Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
            Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging modularity and code reuse.
	2.Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, attract a huge community of developers for Rapid Application Development and deployment.

Q2. What is a dynamically typed language?
	Before we understand a dynamically typed language, we should learn about what typing is. 
	Typing refers to type-checking in programming languages. In a strongly-typed language, 
	such as Python, "1" + 2 will result in a type error since these languages don't allow for "type-coercion" (implicit conversion of data types).
 	On the other hand, a weakly-typed language, such as Javascript, will simply output "12" as result.

Type-checking can be done at two stages -

	Static - Data Types are checked before execution.
	Dynamic - Data Types are checked during execution.
	Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking is done on the fly, 
	during execution. Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language.
